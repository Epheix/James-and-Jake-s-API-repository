This project demonstrates how to use the Spotify API to retrieve an access token and interact with Spotifyâ€™s endpoints. Currently, the code includes functionality to fetch an access token. 
-
The project is written in Python and makes use of the requests library for HTTP requests and the dotenv package for managing sensitive credentials via a .env file.
-
Note: The .env file stores your sensitive Spotify API credentials and is necessary for the code to work.
